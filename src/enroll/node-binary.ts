// detected via `node --version`) or to substitute it with the absolute path

 * `C:Usersu.pinta…` and Node then fails to resolve the script
 * (`Cannot find module 'C:Users…'`). Forward slashes need no escaping in any
 * shell (cmd, PowerShell, bash) and Node accepts them natively on Windows for
 * both module resolution and the interpreter path, so we convert backslashes
 * to forward slashes before a path enters a command line.
 *
 * This is for command STRINGS only — env-file values (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT) and
